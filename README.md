Python Plays Talking Tom Gold Run

## **Edit**
- i've successfully trained a very very basic cnn to atleast make moves, but ig the main issue lies around the very low dataset and the simplicity of the CNN
- I plan on adding a function where it will take on the prediction of the model on the last 5 frames and then on that basis perform the mean or mode on the model's output and do that action in-game
